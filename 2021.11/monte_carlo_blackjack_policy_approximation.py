'''
State-value monte carlo approximation for blackjack

Dealer:
 - While sum(cards) < 17: hit

Agent's policy:
 - If sum(cards) < 20: hit
   - Otherwise, stand.

States:
 - Whether the player has a usable ace (False, True)
 - The sum of the player's cards (12, 21)
 - The card the dealer shows (1 (Ace), 10)
